pyra-hspkg is constructed using a few separate components
Important is to keep everything as simple as possible.
We don't need another PND disaster.

pyra-hspkgd
	- Watches for changes in mountpoints and monitors for new pyra packages
	- Emits desktop files for launching

pya-hspkg-run
	- Runs a pyra package



Structure of a pyra package:

* Squashfs filesystem image for application data
* Appended zip for metadata
	- Does not conflict with existing tools for these formats
* Meta-data in .desktop files
	- Optionally some extra data to define default program when running the
	  package file directly. Keep outside of the .desktop files
